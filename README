Data-FeatureFactory

This module aids generating data frames for statistical learning. It is intended
to be used when you have some raw data and need to evaluate features on them.
It automates conversion of categorial data to numeric or binary format for
machine learning methods that require such inputs - like support vector machines
or neural networks. It provides various checking and conversion options for what
the features return.
